                                    This project demonstrates event-driven programming, game loop logic, and visual UI design principles using block-based coding. In this game a baseball is trying to get across the field for a home run and the player must click on it to get points. Certain things the player does may lose them points and it is all about letting in the least amounts of runs possible.

                                    <p>This app was made using a block-based coding technique on MIT App Inventor to make a  clicker game where the user had to click a sprite (the baseball) as many times as possible in 20 seconds. The ball would go from left to right and when it was clicked it would go to a random spot on the left side of the page and travel across and if it reached the end the user would lose a point. The user would also lose a poitn if they missed the ball when clicking. When the ball is clicked th esprite will change to an image of the ball in a glove to add a sort of "animation" feature as an added design choice. Randomly throughout the game the ball will speed up for a short period of time and then possibly return. After the game ends the user is asked if they want to keep playing using a notifer to display their score. The user may also quit in the middle of the game if they click the button and the notifier. It is a fun game that incorporates multiple fun features to enhance game expierience.</p>

It uses red and blue as colors and E and S replacing the X and O. E and S are the first initials of me and my younger brother and I wanted to add this small bit for him since he always en joyed looking at my code and playing my games. This incorporates simple notifiers to display messages like askign if the players would like to play another round or not.

It can count up to 31 bits and has multiple speeds for an auto counter to make the counting go by faster or slower based on whatever the user wants. You can also add 1 with another button feature and a reset button. It uses specific words to make it feel more sophisticated and is an extremely good counter overall. The task itself required us to ask Gemini to create an app like this and then modify it to what we wanted or preferred. </p>

                                    In this project we created an ASCII converter and a gamge based on What The Hex? as two different projects but go together well. The ASCII converter is fluent in binary, hexadecimal, decimal, and plain text. It can convert text from any lanuage into all of the others including special characters, emogis, symbols, and colors. The game we made with it is a 4x5 square template with 20 colors of very similar shade that also has the hexadecimal number of what the desired color is. The player is meant to figure out the color that is being asked of.

                                    <p>The goal of the project was to make an ASCII converter that is fluent in decimal and plain text but I decided to go above and beyond to add the special features discussed above. Using gemini to create a template we went on to add modifications based on our ideas for the prpject. The hexadecimal was the same process and orginially was meant to ahve all different colors but I decided it would be more interesting to have the similar colors. When splitting your screen betweent he two games you are ab le to put in the hexadecimal number (minus the hashtag) and put it into the ASCII converter where it will show the color and you can compare the colrs until you find the right one. I found this to be a fun way to integrate the two projects and why they are in the same subsection of the portfolio. These both are high quality and efficiently working apps that use unique features to enhance user expierience. </p>
